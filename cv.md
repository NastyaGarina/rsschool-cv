### About

I never thought about becoming a programmer before. But after meeting one developer, after he showed me the world of frontend development, I confidently decided to become a developer. It was difficult for me to decide on a direction. So I decided to try front-end, back-end and mobile development. Most of all I liked the front-end and mobile development. I like programming, it is very interesting and exciting in the future I will become a good developer.
